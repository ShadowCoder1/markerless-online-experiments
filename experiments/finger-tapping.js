/* =============================================================================
 *  finger-tapping.js — tap your index finger against your thumb, fast.
 * =============================================================================
 *
 *  This is a complete, working experiment. Read it top to bottom: it is the
 *  fastest way to understand how experiments are built here. To make your own,
 *  copy experiments/_template.js instead of editing this file.
 *
 *  WHAT IT MEASURES
 *  The distance between the thumb tip and the index fingertip ("aperture").
 *  When you tap, that distance oscillates. Counting the oscillations gives you
 *  tapping rate; their spacing gives you rhythm; their size gives you
 *  amplitude, and whether amplitude shrinks over time (the "sequence effect"
 *  that clinicians look for in Parkinson's disease).
 *
 *  A NOTE ON WHERE THE REAL ANALYSIS HAPPENS
 *  The tap detection below runs live so the participant sees a counter go up.
 *  It is deliberately simple. The numbers you put in a paper should come from
 *  analysis/metrics.py, which re-derives every tap from the raw landmarks with
 *  parameters you can change afterwards. Detecting twice is not a mistake —
 *  it means you are never stuck with a threshold you chose before seeing data.
